<h3>Quirks and Features</h3>
<ul>
<li>OpenWeather limits its forecasts for free accounds to five days, hence, weather predictions lose accuracy beyond this point </li>
<li>To maximise the amount of information displayed when viewing the average trends of individual bike stations loading times of around 10-20 seconds are required. Removing information from these pages to speed up loading times defeats the purpose of the page, hence, the decision was taken to maintain as much information as possible.</li>
<li>The team have found that the webpage tends to function more reliably on Google Chrome, behavious such as horizintal scrolling which has been seen on other browsers is unintended.</li>
